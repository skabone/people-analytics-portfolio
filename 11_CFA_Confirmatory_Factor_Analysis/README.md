# Project 11 - Confirmatory Factor Analysis

Author: Mintay Misgano, PhD

This project applies confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the dimensional structure of the Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women (GRMSAAW). The analysis compares a unidimensional model with a four-factor correlated model using simulated data based on published parameters, and replicates the CFA workflow in both R and Python.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Formal comparison of competing CFA measurement models
- Interpretation of common fit indices including CFI, RMSEA, SRMR, AIC, and chi-square difference tests
- Cross-platform replication using `lavaan` in R and `semopy` in Python
- Psychometric reasoning about when subscales should be scored separately rather than collapsed

## Main Finding

The four-factor model fit the data substantially better than the unidimensional model across every major fit index. The results support treating the GRMSAAW as a multidimensional instrument with distinguishable subscales.

## Data Note

The dataset in this project is simulated from published factor loadings and item-level descriptives. The project is therefore best interpreted as a psychometric methods demonstration and replication exercise rather than as a new empirical validation sample.
